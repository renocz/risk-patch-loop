# Changelog

## 0.9.0 (unreleased)

First public cut of a tool used for one week on one host.

- `rpl scan`: Trivy on running images (by image ID) + CISA KEV; a scan that cannot do its job is never "OK".
- `rpl inventory`: real exposure per container from `docker inspect` and Traefik labels; Internet exposure is "unknown" until host names are provided.
- `rpl risk`: readable score (severity + KEV + sensitive access + role) x exposure factor, with a replay against the owner's verdicts.
- `rpl fixcheck`: registry read and remote scan of the candidate version; verdicts COMPLETE / PARTIAL / NONE / no newer version.
- `rpl proposals`: updates ready to approve; `--apply` runs the stored proposal only.
- `rpl patch`: snapshot, database dump, pin, dry run, recreate, check, automatic rollback; refuses VPN containers.
- 54 unit tests; the registry and Docker parts are not covered by tests.
